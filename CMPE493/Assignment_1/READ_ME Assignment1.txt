_Project Run_ (READ_ME)

The project was written as a python code.

It includes one import statement which is numpy so numpy has to be installed in the environment in order to proceed.

It has to be run as (python assignment1) according to where it is located.

When you run the code there is going to be "enter first string" prompt after entering the
first string there is going to be second prompt saying "enter second string".After entering
the second string the necessary information for levenshtein distance and demarau levenstein distance 
is going to be displayed in the command.

I gave the outcome result examples in the report.

Note:

For operation statements(transpostion is a bit different),
they are shown as cost/operation name/input string element/output string element.

In deletion output string is displayed as *
In insertion input string is displayed as *

For transposition, it is shown as cost/operation name/changed between elements.
